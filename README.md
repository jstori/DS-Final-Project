BLE Fingerprint dataset analysis
this project analysis the BLE dataset from UCI Machine learing Respository

Meterials file contained some of the informations about indoor positioning algorithm, which can provide better understanding of the project

Project File include 4 different part :
  1. coding 
  2. Contains information about BLE's mind map and Project-related images( need to download XMind software to read)
  3. Ibeacon Layout
  4. IBeacon RSSI fingerprint dataset

Indoor location Analysis.pptx is the final project Power Point.
